# 👨‍💻 Kittanate Thanee - Interactive Developer Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio, packed with interactivity and built for top-notch performance using **Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS.** It's not just about listing projects and experience it's a way to show off my skills in DOM manipulation, smooth rendering, and creative UX/UI design.

## ✨ Key Features & Architecture

This portfolio goes beyond a typical static site by incorporating advanced frontend techniques for a highly engaging user experience:

- **🦎 Smart Interactive Mascot:** A custom SVG iguana that brings the page to life. It uses `IntersectionObserver` and custom DOM events to seamlessly hop between sections, track mouse movements, and react to UI changes (like hiding itself when a modal opens).
- **🌌 Smooth Canvas Background:** The background particle effects are built using the HTML5 `<canvas>` API instead of heavy DOM elements. This ensures a fluid, 60FPS parallax scrolling experience without slowing down the browser.
- **⚡ Hardware-Accelerated Animations:** Powered by Anime.js, the animations rely strictly on CSS transforms (like translate, scale, and rotate) rather than layout-altering properties. This minimizes browser repaints and keeps the performance highly efficient.
- **🧱 Data-Driven Architecture:** Built with the "separation of concerns" principle. All content such as the bio, experience, and projects is fully decoupled from the UI and managed centrally in a simple `src/data/data.json` file.
- **💡 Engaging Micro-Interactions:** Includes dynamic spotlight hover effects driven by CSS variables and JS, organic staggered delays, and a live real-time counter tracking current job tenure.
